# Hello, I'm Alexis Pelaez ðŸ¦• (AKA Zyle Kits)

## Background
I grew up in a relatively poor neighborhood in Chicago. It goes by the name of Little Village or South Lawndale. It is predominantly hispanic and that represents me. I am 100% Mexican by blood. Fun fact, despite growing up under a hispanic household, I never was able to learn the Spanish language. It has caused me problems in my family but I do my best to overcome them. I have lived here all my life and I plan to move someday!
